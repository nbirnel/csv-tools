This is csv-tools, 
a small collection of tools for dealing with csv files.

It depends on the CPAN module Text::CSV.

    cpan -i Text::CSV

If you can't or won't use CPAN to get this, 
run `get-TEXT::CSV`,
which is a small shell script using wget.

If you can't or won't run a shell, 
you should probably go elsewhere.
