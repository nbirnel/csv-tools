.SH BUGS
Don't use this with Strawberry Perl.
If you are on Windows,
use Cygwin Perl.
(Not tested with ActiveState Perl.)
Fields are numbered from 1 on the command line,
but internally
are represented from 0.
.SH TODO
Check our arguments better \- are the fields all numbers?
Do the files exist? Did we receive garbage flags?
Add a flag to do conditional matching?
